# 📊 Sorting Visualizer in Java (Swing)

A **Java Swing-based Sorting Visualizer** that provides an interactive and animated experience for learning and understanding popular sorting algorithms. Easily switch between sorting types, array sizes, speed, and sort order!


---

## 🔧 Features

- Visualizes **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Merge Sort**
- Choose between **Ascending** and **Descending** order
- Adjust **array size** and **sorting speed** with intuitive sliders
- Customize **array range** using a dialog
- Stylish UI with gradient background and dynamic value labels
- **Stop** sorting at any time using the "Stop" button

---

## 🧠 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- 🔁 **Bubble Sort**  
- 📌 **Selection Sort**  
- 🔀 **Merge Sort**

Each algorithm is visualized step-by-step, making it easier to understand how sorting happens internally.
